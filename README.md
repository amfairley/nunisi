# Nunisi Hotel and Spa

*A hotel management system for a forest retreat hotel*

This full stack hotel management system is built for use of taking bookings and payment for a forest retreat hotel in the region of Nunisi in Georgia. The business audience is the hotel owners and the target audience for the site are travellers who are seeking a relaxing getaway, either travelling domestically or internationally. The website was created using custom code written in HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript , utilising the full stack framework Django. It is hosted on Heroku with a connected PostgreSQL relational database and provides the users full CRUD functionality.

## Security

**.gitignore**<br>
One of the security steps taken was to put all sensitive and irrelevant information in the .gitignore file so as to not upload them to the public online repository. Those added to this file were:
| Inclusion in .gitignore | Reasoning |
|-----|-----|
| *.sqlite3 | Prevent SQLite database files being tracked by GitHub, as it contains local data that is either not relevant to the development or potentially sensitive. |
| \_\_pycache__ | Contains files generated by the python interpreter which are recreated as needed, so is removed from the version control in order to decrease the size and clutter of the repository. |
| venv | It has the virtual environment information including paths and configurations that won't work for other developers or environments. So it was added to .gitignore to reduce redundancy and clutter in the repository. |
| env.py | To hide sensitive information such asâ€¦ |
|.coverage| The coverage reports for the testing will not require hosting on the repository. Instead, final coverage reports will be added to the [TESTING.md](/TESTING.md) file|
| htmlcov/ | This folder houses the html coverage reports which do not require hosting on the repository. |

**Meta Data**<br>
Some of the meta data included in the head element of the base template and reproduced across every page of the site add extra security to the webapp. 
```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
```
This makes internet explorer avoid compatability issues with older versions of itself that may themselves have security vulnerabilities.
```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
UTF-8 encoding prevents character encoding mismatches that could result in vulnerabilities with cross-site scripting or malicious user input.

**Django Allauth**<br>
AllAuth is an open source Django package that I used to handle user authentication on the website. It is open source, so it is backed by millions of developers who keep it up to date and secure, providing a key part in the security of this website and data-security of the users who will create user accounts with us. The client ID and secret keys for the social sign-ins are kept in the secure admin dashboard.

**crsf tokens**<br>
These are present in all forms on the website, preventing from Cross-site Request Forgery attacks, confirming that the form is submitted by a real user, not a malicious third party.

**Password Security**<br>
Django AllAuth uses the password hashing algorithm PBKDF2 to hash passwords before storing them, allowing them to be stored securely and for the possibility for multiple users to have the same password without impacting site security.

**Email Validation**<br>
As a part of Django-allauth, email validation is required to prevent fake accounts, verify ownership of the email address, and to reduce phishing risks.

**External links**<br>
All external links open in a new tab and have rel="noopener" to prevent the opened page from accessing the pages on this website, increasing security.

**Access required**<br>
On certain pages, the view only loads the page if the user is a superuser or is logged in depending on the requiremnet.

### Defensive Programming

**Password confirmation**<br>
The signup form requires a confirmation of the password to prevent the user from making a typo.

**Email login**<br>
The site login requires the user's email address, since it is harder to recall a username. Since the website does not include any user to user interactions, usernames were deemed an unnecessary complication for users.

**Logout page**<br>
When logging out the user is redirected to a page to confirm log out, preventing the user from logging out accidentally.

**Forms**<br>
Forms throughout the site are defined with required fields when necessary. These prevent the user from submitting an incomplete form and provide a pop up alerting the user as to why the form wasn't submitted.

**Delete room/user**<br>
The delete room/user functionality redirects the user to a confirmation page to remove the chance of accidentally deleting a room or account.

### Future Security Implementations
