# Nunisi Hotel and Spa

*A hotel management system for a forest retreat hotel*

This full stack hotel management system is built for use of taking bookings and payment for a forest retreat hotel in the region of Nunisi in Georgia. The business audience is the hotel owners and the target audience for the site are travellers who are seeking a relaxing getaway, either travelling domestically or internationally. The website was created using custom code written in HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript , utilising the full stack framework Django. It is hosted on Heroku with static files hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), has a connected PostgreSQL relational database and provides the users full CRUD functionality. It provides users with the ability to create and log into a user profile in order to track their previous and upcoming trips and leave reviews. This allows for easier administration by users in the lead up to their trip and a way of verifying reviews so that the business owner can know that recieved reviews are genuine.

The live site can be viewed [here](https://nunisi-hotel-and-spa-39411ddf3dfa.herokuapp.com/)

## Security

**.gitignore**<br>
One of the security steps taken was to put all sensitive and irrelevant information in the .gitignore file so as to not upload them to the public online repository. Those added to this file were:
| Inclusion in .gitignore | Reasoning |
|-----|-----|
| *.sqlite3 | Prevent SQLite database files being tracked by GitHub, as it contains local data that is either not relevant to the development or potentially sensitive. |
| \_\_pycache__ | Contains files generated by the python interpreter which are recreated as needed, so is removed from the version control in order to decrease the size and clutter of the repository. |
| venv | It has the virtual environment information including paths and configurations that won't work for other developers or environments. So it was added to .gitignore to reduce redundancy and clutter in the repository. |
| env.py | To hide sensitive information such asâ€¦ |
|.coverage| The coverage reports for the testing will not require hosting on the repository. Instead, final coverage reports will be added to the [TESTING.md](/TESTING.md) file|
| htmlcov/ | This folder houses the html coverage reports which do not require hosting on the repository. |

**Meta Data**<br>
Some of the meta data included in the head element of the base template and reproduced across every page of the site add extra security to the webapp. 
```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
```
This makes internet explorer avoid compatability issues with older versions of itself that may themselves have security vulnerabilities.
```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
UTF-8 encoding prevents character encoding mismatches that could result in vulnerabilities with cross-site scripting or malicious user input.

**Django Allauth**<br>
AllAuth is an open source Django package that I used to handle user authentication on the website. It is open source, so it is backed by millions of developers who keep it up to date and secure, providing a key part in the security of this website and data-security of the users who will create user accounts with us. The client ID and secret keys for the social sign-ins are kept in the secure admin dashboard.

**crsf tokens**<br>
These are present in all forms on the website, preventing from Cross-site Request Forgery attacks, confirming that the form is submitted by a real user, not a malicious third party.

**Password Security**<br>
Django AllAuth uses the password hashing algorithm PBKDF2 to hash passwords before storing them, allowing them to be stored securely and for the possibility for multiple users to have the same password without impacting site security.

**Email Validation**<br>
As a part of Django-allauth, email validation is required to prevent fake accounts, verify ownership of the email address, and to reduce phishing risks.

**External links**<br>
All external links open in a new tab and have rel="noopener" to prevent the opened page from accessing the pages on this website, increasing security.

**Access required**<br>
On certain pages, the view only loads the page if the user is a superuser or is logged in depending on the requiremnet.

**env.py**<br>
All sensitive values such as passcodes and secret keys were kept in an env.py file and added to the .gitignore in order to prevent them being posted online. An example of the setup of my env.py can be found [here](/env_example.txt) to help set up yours.

### Defensive Programming

**Password confirmation**<br>
The signup form requires a confirmation of the password to prevent the user from making a typo.

**Email login**<br>
The site login requires the user's email address, since it is harder to recall a username. Since the website does not include any user to user interactions, usernames were deemed an unnecessary complication for users.

**Logout page**<br>
When logging out the user is redirected to a page to confirm log out, preventing the user from logging out accidentally.

**Forms**<br>
Forms throughout the site are defined with required fields when necessary. These prevent the user from submitting an incomplete form and provide a pop up alerting the user as to why the form wasn't submitted.

**Delete room/user**<br>
The delete room/user functionality redirects the user to a confirmation page to remove the chance of accidentally deleting a room or account.

**Delete review modal**<br>
The delete review modal pops up to make the user confirm a deletion, preventing them from accidentally deleting thier review with one mouse click.

### Form validation
Form validation is handled throughout the website. When needing more than the built in validation tools, these are included in the forms when a model is accessed or in the view for accessing the database (e.g. searching for available rooms). A good example of this is in the review forms.py file, where there are defined cleaning steps to ensure that the content is a certain length, all sections are present and that the trip being reviewed is in the past.

## Future Development
- Footer
    * Facebook and Instagram links will be updated with the real profiles when the website is ready to go live.
- Allauth updates
    * redirect user to profile page after updating password
- index.html
    * better carousel transitions
- rooms_superuser.html
    * Add carousel for multiple room images
- trips_superuser.html
    * Add column filtering
- user_profile
    * An admin only page allowing them to send an email to everyone signed up to the newsletter
    * An admin only page to show trends in booking and graphical representations of booking trends over the year

## User Feedback
The website was reviewed by friends and family during development. This allowed me to ensure that the highest standards were continuously met by providing feedback on this that did not work well or that were missing. These can be seen during the commits at around halfway through the development, where changes to previously completed apps and issues were revisited the key changes made due to the feedback were:
- Moving trips to its own app for clearer code management
- Adding "back" buttons to pages that needed them for a better user experience
- Allowing the hotel owner to cancel trips using a user interface instead of the admin page
- Adding pagination to available room results and past trips
- Add sorting and filtering to available rooms
- Add sorting to past trips
- Add CRUD for reviews

Additionally, this provided feedback from different screen sizes that I had tested and other browsers that I did not have access to (Safari and Opera). There were no complaints with the working of the website.
