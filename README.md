This full stack hotel management system is built for use of taking bookings and payment for a forest retreat hotel in the region of Nunisi in Georgia. The business audience is the hotel owners and the target audience for the site are travellers who are seeking a relaxing getaway, either travelling domestically or internationally. The website was created using custom code written in HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript , utilising the full stack framework Django. It is hosted on Heroku with a connected PostgreSQL relational database and provides the users full CRUD functionality.

## Security

**.gitignore**<br>
One of the security steps taken was to put all sensitive and irrelevant information in the .gitignore file so as to not upload them to the public online repository. Those added to this file were:
| Inclusion in .gitignore | Reasoning |
|-----|-----|
| *.sqlite3 | Prevent SQLite database files being tracked by GitHub, as it contains local data that is either not relevant to the development or potentially sensitive. |
| \_\_pycache__ | Contains files generated by the python interpreter which are recreated as needed, so is removed from the version control in order to decrease the size and clutter of the repository. |
| venv | It has the virtual environment information including paths and configurations that won't work for other developers or environments. So it was added to .gitignore to reduce redundancy and clutter in the repository. |
| env.py | To hide sensitive information such asâ€¦ |

**Django Allauth**<br>
AllAuth is an open source Django package that I used to handle user authentication on the website. It is open source, so it is backed by millions of developers who keep it up to date and secure, providing a key part in the security of this website and data-security of the users who will create user accounts with us. The client ID and secret keys for the social sign-ins are kept in the secure admin dashboard.

**Password Security**<br>
Django AllAuth uses the password hashing algorithm PBKDF2 to hash passwords before storing them, allowing them to be stored securely and for the possibility for multiple users to have the same password without impacting site security.

**Email Validation**<br>
As a part of Django-allauth, email validation is required to prevent fake accounts, verify ownership of the email address, and to reduce phishing risks.

### Defensive Programming

**Password confirmation**<br>
The signup form requires a confirmation of the password to prevent the user from making a typo.
